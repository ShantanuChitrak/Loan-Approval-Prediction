ðŸš€ Just wrapped up an exciting journey in a recent Kaggle competition focused on loan approval prediction! The goal was to predict whether an applicant would be approved for a loan using a classification model. After conducting extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and diving into the data, I experimented with a range of machine learning models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, CatBoost, and a Neural Network model.
ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights:
Applied thorough EDA and data analysis to uncover trends and insights.
Achieved a 95% accuracy with CatBoost and Neural Network models, which provided the best results.
Secured a rank of 2069 among global participants!
